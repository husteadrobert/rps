This web app was made to practice the skills I have learned in course 170: Web Development at <a href="https://launchschool.com">Launch School</a>.

This basic purpose of this web app was for me to create something using the Sinatra framework for Ruby, while demonstrating the various skills I had learned.  The layout of the pages themselves is not particularly pleasing to the eye, but that is mostly a result of not having studied HTML or CSS to a degree beyond the basics.  Moreover, this app is hosted on Heroku, so new users are not permanent.  For a future improvement, I'd like to make new users permanent and change the layout to be more appealing.

Launch School is an online program aimed at mastery based education for those who want to learn how to become professional web application developers.
If you're interested in learning how to program, I invite you to check out their web page <a href="https://launchschool.com">HERE</a>.  I've been a student for about 4 months now, and I feel their approach to mastery (as opposed to just following tutorials to build a 'portfolio') is a perfect fit for a person like me who wants to make a future career out of programming.
